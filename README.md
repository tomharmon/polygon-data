# Polygon Data CLI

This is a simple CLI to help download data from the Polygon platform.

# Status

It's not the shiniest CLI ever, but it works for my needs, and thus
I don't plan to improve it beyond fixing the progress bar 
underestimating the amount of work required due to Polygon doing
something interesting with basing your chunk size off base aggregation
bars.
